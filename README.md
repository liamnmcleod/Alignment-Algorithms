# Alignment-Algorithms
DNA alignment &amp; string-matching algorithms in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of classic genomic string-matching and alignment algorithms (e.g., naive search, Boyer–Moore, Needleman–Wunsch). The code is adapted from teaching materials by Ben Langmead (Johns Hopkins University) as part of the Python for Genomic Data Science course. It’s intended for learning and reproducibility, not as a production-grade aligner.
